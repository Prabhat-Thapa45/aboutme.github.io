__Visual Studio Code__ is a source code editor developed by __Microsoft__ for _Windows, Linux and macOS_. It is based on __Electron__, a framework which is used to deploy Node.js applications for the desktop running on the Blink layout engine.

It was announced on _April 29, 2015 by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference_. On _April 14, 2016_, it was released to public. The source code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/).

So why do I love this text editor? Simple answer would be "Coz it's awesomme." 
Let's see some cool features : <br>

- The UI/UX is amazing. You have to try this for yourself to see it. I'm confident you will love it. If you want to customize further on then you are provided with hundreds of themes in __Extension__ tab.

    Here is a sample screenshot.

- It falls on the sweet spot between simple light code editor and a IDE. It's fast, light and has features like __Always-On IntelliSense__, __Side-by-Side Editing__, __Huge Language Support__ and blah blah blah!

- I'm a huge fan of __Integrated Version Control__ feature. This is very handy for _staging_, _commiting_ and _reverting_.

- Another cool thing is that it has __Integrated Terminal__ which opens up many terminal windows on the bottom of the screen. You can toggle this by `` Ctrl + ` ``.

- There is another great feature called __Peek__ which is toggled by `Shift + F12`. While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.
With __Peek__, you can select a function then hit `Shift + F12`. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. The feature currently works in _C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET,_ and a few other programming languages.

- Extensions are editor's best friend. __VS Code__ has a market full of these which can help you get coding easily. [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) is the link for the market if interested. Some must have for me are :

    5. A clean dark theme : [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)

> Note : Before __VS Code__ I used __Sublime text__ and __Atom__. Both were kinda nice but it wasn't the best for me. __VS Code__ is were I am settled for now. It's fast and comfortable to use. I can't think of any other reason why I should be switching. "Good work __Microsoft__, you guys nailed it" , I'd say.

These are some cool things I like about __VS Code__. Feel free to shoot me a mail or comment to let me know about your favorite feature, extension or theme.
