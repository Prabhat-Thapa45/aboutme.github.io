__Visual Studio Code__ is a source code editor developed by __Microsoft__ for _Windows, Linux and macOS_. It is based on __Electron__, a framework which is used to deploy Node.js applications for the desktop running on the Blink layout engine.

It was announced on _April 29, 2015 by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference_. On _April 14, 2016_, it was released to public. The source code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/).

So why do I love this text editor? Simple answer would be "Coz it's awesomme." 
Let's see some cool features : <br>

- The UI/UX is amazing. You have to try this for yourself to see it. I'm confident you will love it. If you want to customize further on then you are provided with hundreds of themes in __Extension__ tab.

- It falls on the sweet spot between simple light code editor and a IDE. It's fast, light and has features like __Always-On IntelliSense__,__Side-by-Side Editing__,__Huge Language Support__ and blah blah blah!

- I'm a huge fan of __Integrated Version Control__ feature. This is very handy for _staging_, _commiting_ and _reverting_.

- Another cool thing is that it has __Integrated Terminal__ which opens up many terminal windows on the bottom of the screen. You can toggle this by `` ctrl+` ``
